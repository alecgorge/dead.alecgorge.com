## selected 5-star reviews

> I rarely write app reviews, but with the recent update I felt compelled to share with people how truly amazing this app is. It is beautiful, functional, well thought out and on and on. If you like the Dead, it is a must have, if you just want to see what a music streaming app should be, download it to check it out.

> Love this app! Can't say that enough. I've had issues with other music streaming apps (I'm looking at you, livephish!) and this is a superior product. I love the Scrobbler integration and especially the fact that it runs in the background while I perform other tasks. A++! No joke...
